# Student Management System
## 📌 Project Overview
This is a console-based **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** application for managing student records built in **Java**.  
The system provides a simple command-line interface to perform essential data management operations on student information stored in memory using **ArrayList**.

## 💡 Why I Built This Project
I developed this student management system to demonstrate fundamental Java programming concepts and showcase proficiency in:
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Implementing classes with proper encapsulation using getters/setters  
- **Data Structure Usage**: Utilizing ArrayList for dynamic data storage and manipulation  
- **CRUD Operations**: Implementing the four basic database operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)  
- **User Interface Design**: Creating an intuitive menu-driven console interface for user interaction  
- **Input Validation**: Adding duplicate ID prevention to ensure data integrity

## 🚀 Key Features
- ➕ **Add Student Records**: Insert new student data with unique ID validation  
- 📋 **View All Students**: Display complete list of enrolled students  
- ✏️ **Update Student Information**: Modify existing student details by ID  
- ❌ **Delete Student Records**: Remove students from the system  
- 🔒 **Duplicate Id Prevention**: Ensures no two students can have the same ID  
- 🖥️ **Menu-Driven Interface**: Simple numbered options for easy navigation

## ⚙️ Technical Implementation
- **Language**: Java  
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA  
- **Data Storage**: In-memory using `ArrayList<Student>`  
- **Design Pattern**: Simple procedural approach with object-oriented principles  
- **Input Handling**: `Scanner` class for console input/output

## 🎯 Learning Objectives Achieved
This project helped me practice:
- Class design and object instantiation  
- ArrayList operations (`add`, `remove`, `iterate`, `search`)  
- Loop constructs and conditional statements  
- Exception handling and input validation  
- Code organization and method decomposition

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- 💾 File-based data persistence  
- 🔍 Search functionality by name or marks  
- 📊 Data sorting options  
- ✅ Input validation for marks range
