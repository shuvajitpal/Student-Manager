# 👨🏻‍🎓 Student Management System
## 📌 Project Overview  
This is a **console-based CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application** for managing student records built in **Java ☕**.  
The system provides a simple **command-line interface 🖥️** to perform essential data management operations on student information stored in memory using **ArrayList 📂**.  
## 💡 Why I Built This Project  
I developed this student management system to demonstrate fundamental **Java programming concepts 💻** and showcase proficiency in:  
- 🏛️ **Object-Oriented Programming:** Implementing classes with proper encapsulation using getters/setters  
- 📂 **Data Structure Usage:** Utilizing ArrayList for dynamic data storage and manipulation  
- 📝 **CRUD Operations:** Implementing the four basic database operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)  
- 🎛️ **User Interface Design:** Creating an intuitive menu-driven console interface for user interaction  
- 🔒 **Input Validation:** Adding duplicate ID prevention to ensure data integrity  
## ⭐ Key Features  
- ➕ **Add Student Records:** Insert new student data with unique ID validation  
- 📋 **View All Students:** Display complete list of enrolled students  
- ✏️ **Update Student Information:** Modify existing student details by ID  
- ❌ **Delete Student Records:** Remove students from the system  
- 🔒 **Duplicate Id Prevention:** Ensures no two students can have the same ID  
- 🖥️ **Menu-Driven Interface:** Simple numbered options for easy navigation  
## ⚙️ Technical Implementation  
- ☕ **Language:** Java  
- 🏗️ **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA  
- 📂 **Data Storage:** In-memory using ArrayList<Student>  
- 🧩 **Design Pattern:** Simple procedural approach with object-oriented principles  
- ⌨️ **Input Handling:** Scanner class for console input/output  
## 🎯 Learning Objectives Achieved  
This project helped me practice:  
- 🏗️ Class design and object instantiation  
- 📂 ArrayList operations (add, remove, iterate, search)  
- 🔄 Loop constructs and conditional statements  
- ⚠️ Exception handling and input validation  
- 📑 Code organization and method decomposition    
## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- 💾 File-based data persistence  
- 🔍 Search functionality by name or marks  
- 📊 Data sorting options  
- ✅ Input validation for marks range
